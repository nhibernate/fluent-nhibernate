# Contribution Guidelines

The wiki has a page on contributing to FNH:

https://github.com/nhibernate/fluent-nhibernate/wiki/Contributing

## Important
If you've just pulled the FNH code into a local git repository for the first time, its really important that you set the core.autocrlf setting to false to avoid running into whitespace/line ending issues. Do this using the following command:

```
git config core.autocrlf false
```
